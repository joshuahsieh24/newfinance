# FinanceAI - Intelligent Transaction Analysis

A Next.js application that analyzes bank transaction data using machine learning and AI to identify potentially risky or unusual transactions.

## What it does

Upload your bank CSV file and the app will:
- Parse and display your transactions in a clean table format
- Run each transaction through a machine learning model to calculate risk scores
- Generate AI-powered insights for high-risk transactions
- Flag anomalies based on both rule-based logic and ML predictions
- Store all analyzed data in Supabase with Rust WASM-powered encryption
- Provide enterprise-grade security with AES-256-GCM encryption and PBKDF2 key derivation

The ML model considers factors like transaction amount, merchant frequency, category patterns, and timing to assess risk. Incoming payments (money received) are treated with lower sensitivity than outgoing payments.

## Features

- **CSV Upload**: Drag and drop or click to upload bank statement CSVs
- **Risk Scoring**: ML-powered risk assessment for each transaction
- **AI Insights**: Contextual advice for high-risk transactions using GPT-3.5
- **Full Screen View**: Expand the table for better readability of advice
- **Anomaly Filtering**: Toggle to show only flagged transactions
- **Data Persistence**: All transactions are stored in Supabase
- **Rust WASM Encryption**: High-performance AES-256-GCM encryption with Web Crypto API fallback
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and pnpm (or npm)
- Rust and wasm-pack (for building encryption module)
- Supabase account and project
- OpenAI API key (for AI insights)

## Setup

### 1. Clone and install dependencies

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd financeai
pnpm install
```

### 2. Build the Rust WASM encryption module

The app uses a Rust WebAssembly module for high-performance encryption. Build it first:

```bash
cd apps/web/src/lib/wasm
./build.sh
```

This will:
- Install wasm-pack if not already installed
- Compile the Rust encryption module to WebAssembly
- Output the compiled files to `apps/web/public/wasm/`

### 3. Environment variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the `apps/web` directory:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key_here
```

Get your Supabase credentials from:
- Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Project Settings ‚Üí API
- Copy the Project URL and anon/public key

### 4. Start the ML service

The app uses a FastAPI service for ML model scoring. Start it in a separate terminal:

```bash
cd services/ml-api
python model_api.py
```

This will start the ML service on port 8000.

### 5. Start the Next.js app

```bash
cd apps/web
pnpm dev
```

The app will be available at http://localhost:3000

## Usage

1. Open the app in your browser
2. Upload a CSV file with your bank transactions
3. Wait for the analysis to complete (ML scoring + AI insights)
4. Review the results in the table
5. Use the "Full Screen View" button for better readability
6. Toggle "Show only anomalies" to focus on flagged transactions

## CSV Format

Your CSV should have columns for:
- Date
- Description/Merchant
- Amount (negative for debits, positive for credits)

The app will automatically detect and parse common CSV formats.

## Architecture

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- **ML Service**: FastAPI with scikit-learn model
- **Database**: Supabase with row-level encryption
- **AI**: OpenAI GPT-3.5 for contextual insights
- **Encryption**: Rust WASM module with AES-256-GCM and PBKDF2
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components

## Security Features

### üîê Rust WASM Encryption
- **AES-256-GCM** encryption for sensitive transaction data
- **PBKDF2** key derivation with 100,000 iterations
- **Random IV and salt** generation for each encryption
- **Web Crypto API fallback** if WASM module fails to load
- **Base64 encoding** for safe storage and transmission

### üõ°Ô∏è Performance Benefits
- **Native Rust performance** for cryptographic operations
- **Smaller bundle size** compared to pure JavaScript implementations
- **Memory safety** guaranteed by Rust's type system
- **Cross-platform compatibility** through WebAssembly

### üîß Development
The encryption module is located in `apps/web/src/lib/wasm/`:
- `src/lib.rs` - Main Rust implementation
- `Cargo.toml` - Rust dependencies
- `build.sh` - Build script for wasm-pack
- `encryption-wasm.ts` - TypeScript wrapper with fallback

To rebuild the WASM module after changes:
```bash
cd apps/web/src/lib/wasm
./build.sh
```
